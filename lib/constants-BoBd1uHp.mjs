* disagreement was not academic — `daily` existed in one and not the other, so a
* daily group parsed and display-sorted correctly, then contributed an EMPTY
* record that replaced a real measurement.
*
* Keeping both facts in one row is deliberate: a token cannot be rankable in one
* consumer and unknown to the other, because there is only one place to add it.
* A missing `kind` means the cache has nowhere to put that reading, which is what
* stops the empty-record overwrite.
*
* Declared in this leaf rather than in either consumer because BOTH need it:
* `runtime/` must not reach into `adapter/`, and the persisted `QuotaWindow` is
* already defined here.
*

* intended duration ordering: `daily` (5 chars) would otherwise sort before
