/**
 * Model visibility: a per-provider blacklist of model ids hidden from the DSH
 * model selector.
 *
 * Mechanism: DSH's selector reads `session.modelCatalog`, which calls
 * `ctx.llm.listModels(provider)` -> `AgyAdapter.listModels()`. Filtering inside
 * the adapter is therefore sufficient to hide a model from the picker without
 * touching DSH — no host patch, no new RPC.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * - Blacklist, not whitelist. Only explicitly-disabled models are hidden, so a
 *   model the server adds later still shows up. A whitelist would silently hide
 *   every new model until the user re-enabled it.
 * - Persisted to agy's own file rather than a `ctx.settings` namespace. The
 *   settings service requires a `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` schema, and the
 *   standalone CLI must not import any `@deepseek-ai/*` package at runtime
 *   (AGENTS.md invariant). agy already owns plain JSON state with the same
 *   atomic-write pattern (`agy-accounts.json`), so this stays consistent and
 *   lets the CLI read the same blacklist.
 *
 * Only `true` counts as disabled; an id maps to `true` or is absent. Enabling
 * deletes the key, so the file holds just the hidden set and cannot grow with
 * every toggle.

 * without rebuilding the adapter or restarting the host. Writes go through the
 * file immediately (toggles are rare, user-initiated).
 *
 * `disabledFor()` also revalidates against the file's mtime and reloads when it
 * moved. Two instances of this class routinely coexist in ONE process — the
 * main plugin entry and the web entry each build their own runtime — and a
 * toggle is written by the web instance while the model selector reads the main
 * instance. Without the mtime check the selector would keep serving its stale
 * in-memory copy, so switching a model off appeared to do nothing until the
 * host restarted (the `llm/adapters-updated` notification fires, the picker
 * refreshes, and the model is still listed). The same check is what lets a CLI
 * toggle be seen by a running server.
